Description about project:
	Panzer is a two-player artillery game where each player has a tank and certain weapons to hit the other player's tank.
	The player receives points based on weapon used, proximity of detonation and number of impacts and the power of the detonation.
	It is a turnwise game where each player waits for their turn.
	It has two modes -  v/s computer and v/s human.
	Pygame library was used to develop the graphical components of the game.
	We used vector graphics rather than raster graphics to improve visual effects of the game and provide accurate scaling.
